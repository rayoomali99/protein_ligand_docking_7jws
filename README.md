# Protein–Ligand Docking Project (7JWS – Telmisartan)

### Overview
This project performs molecular docking of the **Telmisartan** ligand with the **7JWS** protein structure to predict their binding interaction and visualize the best binding pose.

### Tools Used
- **AutoDock 4** for docking simulation  
- **Discovery Studio Visualizer** for visualization and pose analysis  

### Files
- `7jws.pdb` → Protein structure  
- `telmisartan.pdb` → Ligand structure  
- `7jws.pdbqt`, `telmisartan.pdbqt` → Prepared files for AutoDock  
- `7jws_pose7_best_complex.pdb` → Final docked complex (best binding pose)  
- `7jws.dlg` → Docking log file (binding energy results)

### Best Pose
- Pose 7 was selected as the best docking conformation based on its **lowest binding energy** and **optimal interaction geometry** within the binding pocket.  
- Visualization in Discovery Studio confirmed stable hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts.

# 🧬 Protein–Ligand Docking Project: 7JWS – Telmisartan

### 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **molecular docking** of the antihypertensive drug *Telmisartan* with the **Vitamin D Binding Protein (PDB ID: 7JWS)** using *AutoDock 4*.  
The goal was to identify the most stable ligand–protein binding pose based on the lowest binding energy and strongest interactions.

### ⚙️ Files Description
| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `7jws.pdb` | Protein structure |
| `telmisartan.pdb` | Ligand structure |
| `7jws.pdbqt`, `telmisartan.pdbqt` | Prepared files for AutoDock |
| `7jws_pose7_best_complex.pdb` | Final docked complex (best binding pose) |
| `7jws.dlg` | Docking log file (binding energy results) |

### 🧩 Best Pose
- **Pose 7** was selected as the best docking conformation based on its **lowest binding energy** and **optimal interaction** with the binding pocket.  
- Visualization in **Discovery Studio** confirmed **stable hydrogen bonds** and **hydrophobic contacts**.
